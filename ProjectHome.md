## Introduction ##
Hello good people, I might be an unknown factor in all this but I'm now El Capitan of the Poine project. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Greek mythology Poine is the goddess of retribution and vengence. The name is a temporary and will be changed when the first working beta is out.

## Fork me? Fork you! ##
This project is a fork from the popular Travian Clone. A fork means that we have taken the code at a specific date and will make a project based on that. The difference is that we have our own agenda when it comes to where this will go. Another important thing to note is that the license now is a MIT license which means that you can take our open-source and make it your own, sell it or print it out and throw it at people on the street.

## Agenda? ##
The idea is to try and inch away from the complete clone of travian and instead make a modular client where you can make a css-template, some images and by yourself change the names and stats of troops. For instance if you would like to add a new troop type to what ever you call your game, you would just go to admin > troops > add new, add some stats and upload an image and it would be done. Thus you will be able to create your own army, or for that matter your own game since we aim to make the whole deal more simple to skin!

## What we need! ##
Do you feel like you can contribute? Do you think that you have some ideas or input on the matter?

## Notice! ##
Any questions on how to install WILL be ignored if you do not know how to do this wait for the BETA! Or even better learn php/sql and help us out or create your own fork.

## TESTING!?! ##
Oh MY GaWD do we have a working source?!? Well yes we have ;) this is the latest working build of [Poine](http://testing.b-landia.net).

[SVN client](http://www.rapidsvn.org/download/release/0.12/)

## SVN ##
Here are the SVN for those who are interested in that sort of thing. SVN.

Like with the SVN some amount of work is needed since you have to guess the password. To help you on the way I have two hints; Watch the first movie in LOTR (the fellowship) the second hint is that the username is Friend...
